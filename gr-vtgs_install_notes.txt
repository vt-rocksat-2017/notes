Notes on compiling and installing gr-vtgs on E310

clean git clone to host, plank and gr-vtgs
in planck and gr-vtgs:
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make 
    make install

opened grc: blocks found in list.
scp'd tx_scram_sock.py to E310
executed tx_scram_sock.py:  import Error could not find gr-vtgs.

back to gr-vtgs/build
make uninstall to remove
make clean to clean
in build directory:
    cmake -j2 ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
    make -j2
    make install

Worked, got past importing gr-vtgs
still failed with note about multiplicative scrambler--> think plank install in wrong place.

in ~/plank/build:
    make uninstall
    cmake -j2 ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
    make -j2
    make install

Worked!  launched flowgraph, I think

Seems to be working with random data flowgraph
