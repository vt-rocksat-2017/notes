Hume E310 Notes:
P/N:  156333D-01L
S/N: 30CB3CB

Because of the 'D' in the part number Correct Image for SD card is in 'ettus-e3xx-sg1' folder for ettus images.

Image downloaded from:
http://files.ettus.com/e3xx_images/e3xx-release-4/ettus-e3xx-sg1/

Specific image:  sdimage-gnuradio-demo.direct.xz 
This image is larger, but contains X-window.

Installing image to Sandisk Ultra 32GB MicroSD HC-I, 10 class SD Card
Shows up as sdb and sdb1 in ubuntu VM

df -h shows /dev/sdb1 as 30 GB partition
gparted shows sdb1 as fat32 formatted

Extracted SD card with file manage, right click 'extract here' -- FAILED

Extracted SD card with 'unxz' utilities
'unxz sdimage-gnuradio-demo.direct.xz'

resulting image is 7515821056 bytes in size (~7 GB)

use 'dd' tool to write image to SD card:
sudo dd if="sdimage-gnuradio-demo.direct" of="/dev/sdb1" bs=1M
dd output:
7167+1 records in
7167+1 records out

After SD Card image burn, no Serial Console Access.
All LEDs on USRP light up.

Original SD Card allows serial console access.
Original SD Card, when inserted with USB adapter into laptop, shows boot and root files.
New SD Card does not automount when inserted.


Trying to burn SD card again, this time to root 'sdb' device isntead of 'sdb1'
sudo dd if="sdimage-gnuradio-demo.direct" of="/dev/sdb" bs=1M
dd output:
7167+1 records in
7167+1 records out
7515821056 bytes (7.5 GB, 7.0 GiB) copied, 630.07 s, 11.9 MB/s

root and boot mount available!
Serial Console appears to be working!

PARTITION EDITS (PAYLOAD SD CARD):
on host machine with E310 SD Card accessed via USB adapter
use 'sudo gparted'
had some issues with accesssing SD card immediately after dd burn.
removed, re-inserted SD Card. Fixed issues with gparted.
first create SWAP partition (4096 MiB, linux swap)
Move to end of file system.
Applied Changes.
selected /dev/sdb2
resized partition to fill gap to SWAP partition.
applied changes. worked.

Problem with SD Card during boot after resizing.
Output from Serial Console:
reading system.dtb
spl_load_image_fat_os: error reading image system.dtb, err - -1
reading u-boot.img
reading u-boot.img

PARTITION EDITS (Command SD CARD):
1.  created swap partition (4096 MiB), placed at end of disk.
2.  created new ext4 extension with remaing space.
3.  left existing partition alone
4.  applied changes, sdb3 -> swap, sdb4-> new ext4 space

SD card in E310 ->  boot works, new partitions not mount/recognized.

read partitions on E310 using:  'fdisk -l'
fdisk output:

Edit /etc/fstab to add line for mounting swap partition:
added to end of fstab:
/dev/mmcblk0p3	     none		  swap	     sw                    0  0

rebooted E310, htop now shows swap partition present!  Woot!

added line to end of fstab:
/dev/mmcblk0p4       /mnt                 auto       defaults              0  0
rebooted e310.
df -h recognizes /mnt folder with 18+ GB available for use!  woot!


TEsting writes to /mnt folder are on new partition:
used dd tool to create a file of zeroes:
in mnt folder:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test.dat bs=1M count=1k
df -h shows space consumed on that partition
output from dd utility:
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 91.8301 s, 11.7 MB/s

This is a problem!  relatively slow write speed, may not be able to record IQ!


Trying Pixtor SD Card, UHS-3, "95 MB/s" speed
7167+1 records in
7167+1 records out
7515821056 bytes (7.5 GB, 7.0 GiB) copied, 647.083 s, 11.6 MB/s

dd test:  dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test.dat bs=1M count=1k
dd test output:
1024+0 records in
1024+0 records out
1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 68.6844 s, 15.6 MB/s


Second Pixtor SD Card, UHS-3, 
7167+1 records in
7167+1 records out
7515821056 bytes (7.5 GB, 7.0 GiB) copied, 469.554 s, 16.0 MB/s

dd test:
dd test output:
512+0 records in
512+0 records out
536870912 bytes (537 MB) copied, 28.7657 s, 18.7 MB/s

Better write speed, but not great.
